    Generating Test Reports (Extended Goal):
        Implement a feature that generates a detailed report after each test execution, showing which tests passed, which failed, and any error descriptions.
        This will help in tracking the test results and identifying potential issues quickly.

    Building a Simple API (Extended Goal):
        Create a simple API that stores the test execution results in a database (e.g., DynamoDB).
        This will enable you to analyze trends in test execution and gather insights into the overall health of the application.
