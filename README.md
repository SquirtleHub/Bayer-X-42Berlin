>Building An Automated Test Framework

## Installation

We gonna use Cypress in this project, to set up thing kindly follow the steps :

> Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. If you don't have it installed, you can download and install it from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/

* Of course you wanna clone the repo first and cd into it .
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>

```
* Install project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
 * Start the Cypress Test Runner:

```bash
npx cypress open

```

## TO DO LIST
    Selecting the Technology:
Done ✓

    Environment Setup:
Done ✓

    Implementing Low-Level Actions (Week 1):
Done ✓

    Defining Test Cases (Week 1):
Done ✓

    Implementing Test Cases (Week 2): 
        Now that you have low-level actions and defined test cases, proceed to implement the test cases using the chosen automation tool.
        Write automated scripts that utilize the low-level actions to execute the test cases.

    Implementing Business-Level Actions (Week 3):
        For this step, you'll reimplement the test cases using business-level actions.
        Business-level actions abstract the low-level interactions into more meaningful and understandable actions related to the business processes of the application.

    Generating Test Reports (Extended Goal):
        Implement a feature that generates a detailed report after each test execution, showing which tests passed, which failed, and any error descriptions.
        This will help in tracking the test results and identifying potential issues quickly.

    Building a Simple API (Extended Goal):
        Create a simple API that stores the test execution results in a database (e.g., DynamoDB).
        This will enable you to analyze trends in test execution and gather insights into the overall health of the application.

    Showcase and Presentation (Week 4):
        Prepare a showcase and presentation of your automated test framework project for the Bayer Berlin event.
        Highlight the features, benefits, and potential impact of your framework on the testing process.
